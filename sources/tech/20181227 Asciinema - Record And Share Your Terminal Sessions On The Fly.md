Asciinema – Record And Share Your Terminal Sessions On The Fly
======

This is known topic and we had already written so many article about this topic.

Even today also we are going to discuss about the same topic.

Other tools are works locally but Asciinema works in both way like local and web.

I mean we can share the recording on the web.

By default everyone prefer history command to review/recall the previously entered commands in terminal.

But unfortunately, that shows only the commands that we ran and doesn’t shows the commands output which was performed previously.

There are many utilities available in Linux to record the terminal session activity.

Also, we had written about few utilities in the past and today also we are going to discuss about the same kind of topic.

If you would like to check other utilities to record your Linux terminal session activity then you can give a try to **[Script Command][1]** , **[Terminalizer Tool][2]** and **[Asciinema Tool][3]**.

But if you are looking for **[GIF Recorder][4]** then try **[Gifine][5]** , **[Kgif][6]** and **[Peek][7]** utilities.

### What is Asciinema

asciinema is a free and open source solution for recording terminal sessions and sharing them on the web.

When you run asciinema rec in your terminal the recording starts, capturing all output that is being printed to your terminal while you’re issuing the shell commands.

When the recording finishes (by hitting `Ctrl-D` or typing `exit`) then the captured output is uploaded to asciinema.org website and prepared for playback on the web.

Asciinema project is built of several complementary pieces such as asciinema command line tool, API at asciinema.org and javascript player.

Asciinema was inspired by script and scriptreplay commands.

asciinema: press "ctrl-d" or type "exit" when you're done
```

For testing purpose run few commands and see whether it’s working fine or not.

Once you have done, simple press `CTRL+D` or type `exit` to stop the recording. The result will be saved in the same directory.

```
$ exit
exit
asciinema: recording finished
asciinema: asciicast saved to 2g-test
```

If you would like to save the output in the different directory then mention the path where you want to save the file.

```
$ asciinema rec /opt/session-record/2g-test1
```

We can play the recorded session using the following command.

```
$ asciinema play 2g-test
```

We can play the recorded session with double speed.

```
$ asciinema play -s 2 2g-test
```

Alternatively we can play the recorded session with normal speed with idle time limited to 2 seconds.

```
$ asciinema play -i 2 2g-test
```

### How To Share the Recorded Session on The Web

It will be automatically archived 7 days after upload.

```
$ asciinema upload 2g-test

If you have already recorded an asciicast but you don’t see it on your profile on asciinema.org website. Just run the `asciinema auth` command in your terminal to move those.

```
$ asciinema auth
